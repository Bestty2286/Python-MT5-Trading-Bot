### üìà Strategy Explained

The core logic of this bot is based on a **20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)** crossover strategy on a 1-minute timeframe.

- **BUY Signal:** A buy order is triggered when the closing price of the previous candle moves *above* the SMA line.
- **SELL Signal:** A sell order is triggered when the closing price of the previous candle moves *below* the SMA line.
- The bot only looks for a new signal if there are no other open positions with its specific "Magic Number".

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Usage

1.  Ensure you have Python and MetaTrader 5 installed.
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install MetaTrader5 pandas
    ```
3.  In the MetaTrader 5 terminal, go to `Tools -> Options -> Expert Advisors` and check "Allow algorithmic trading".
4.  Run the `expert.py` script.

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Implementing a robust backtesting module.
- [ ] Adding risk management features (Stop-Loss and Take-Profit).
- [ ] Integrating other technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) for more complex strategies.
- [ ] Developing a more sophisticated logging system.
